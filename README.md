# Project: Flight Booker

This project is based on the [Ruby on Rails course of The Odin Project, Flight Booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

This is about tackling with more advanced forms like populating dropdown menus, radio buttons, working with nested attributes, complex user orders (booking flights), and integration of billing information (I have yet to find out how integrating billing information works).

## Learning Outcomes

To be completed soon.

## Screenshots
